/**
 * This is a basic template that contains selectors for **every single control existing in GIMP**!
 * This will make it easy to you to edit GIMPs Look & Feel thoroughly.
 * If you're not sure how to edit gtkrc-files head over to the gtkrc-documentation:
 * https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/GnomeArt/Tutorials/GtkThemes
 *
 * Have a look at the different files included into this file in order to learn how to edit the theme of every single control in GIMP.
 * Use the "Test"-style in order to try out your own selectors.
